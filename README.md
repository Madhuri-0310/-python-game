This is a 2D side-scrolling shooting game built with Pygame. The player moves left and right, jumps, and shoots bullets at an enemy (a goblin). The game includes collision detection, a score system, and sound effects.

If the player gets hit by the goblin, they lose 5 points. If their health runs out or they lose, a GAME OVER screen appears.
